BOM-browers browers objet Model it additional object it provied additional objects

DOM-complete html page that page is called DOM object.
DOM has all the methdos that server needs.. like html page http & https 
request & responce.it has objects that can perfrom on server.
DOM shows a structure of document as tree format whatever we add styles for web pages

to access dom in progect use document.getElementById(id) it ll select dom elemets by id.
document.getElementById('myElement').innerText = 'New Content';

DOM elemet are not acceciable.it is readonly

$ are use to refer back Element
